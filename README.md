Transactions Library for AWEBER.com (opt-in email marketing service)

Transactions Library for AWEBER.com (opt-in email marketing service) I just want to make this as clear as possible, I do not work for aweber. The Code Shown here has been created to give new developers a helping hand with setting up new apps and to contribute code for future endavors like some of the Beta tools aweber has been pushing out.

I am asuming that the API library has been downloaded and it is located in your root folder in order for this code to work.

PS. If you didn't already know. this code is PHP based.
